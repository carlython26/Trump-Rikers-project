# Trump's Rikers
## Note:
* index2.html is the correct file
## Aim:
* Is there a way to find out more about what Trump's time would be like in prison, if he were convicted?
## Data collection:
* I used the NYC OpenData Daily Inmate Population dataset.
* Where necessary, I consulted other explanatory sources, like the NYC penal code.
## Overview data analysis:
* I used pandas and matplotlib for most of the analysis
* For visualization, I used Datawrapper, Flourish and Adobe Illustrator.
## If I had more time:
* I had spent more time on making the graphics more beautiful.
* It would have been a scrolly story, which would have worked well for some of the visualization.
* I would have used more of my analysis in the story, like the analysis about the sentence lengths in Rikers.
